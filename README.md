**TASK 1:-**
Here I am attaching the API's and the screen for the following, you need to implement the
api for the particular screen to show the data at the frontend.

This api is for the therapy screen

**Task 2 :-**
Here are the following points for Machine Test.
1. Build a Landscape Activity with two Recyclerview in it aligned horizontally.
2. Activity should be held in landscape mode and should be subdivided into
two equal parts horizontally with Recyclerview A positioned on left and
Recyclerview B on right. Both Recyclerview A and Recyclerview B should
be visible at the same time.
3. Recyclerview A will have 10 alphabetic elements inside by default which
would include A to J.
4. Recyclerview B would be empty by default.
5. Users can select multiple elements at once in any of the Recyclerview and
can move them from Recyclerview A to Recyclerview B or from
Recyclerview B to Recyclerview A using the buttons - “Move to Right” and
“Move to Left” respectively.
6. Remove the selected elements from the previous Recyclerview while
moving them to another Recyclerview.
7. When you select multiple numbers from Recyclerview A and move them to
Recyclerview B, You should remove them from Recyclerview A. It should
work in CUT AND PASTE FASHION,
8. Each cell will have a ‘+’ button, - button and a TextView with default score
of 0.
9. When the user taps on the ‘+’ button, increment consecutive scores inside
the cell by 1. It should work for multiple ‘+’ taps as well. For Ex. I can tap on
‘+’ 5 times to increment the value by 5.
10. Each ‘-’ tap should decrease the score by 1.
11. When any alphabet is moved to another Recyclerview - its current score
should be moved as well with the cell.
12. Users should be able to select multiple elements from Recyclerview and
move them from one Recyclerview to another.
13. Elements moved should append to the end of the list.

Here is the video that demonstrate the task -:

Note :- Both the tasks should be done by using MVVM architecture. Advance coding
standards will be highly appreciated.
